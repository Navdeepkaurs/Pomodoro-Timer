# Pomodoro-Timer
🍅🍅🍅 POMODORO TIMER! 🍅🍅🍅 is a simple yet effective productivity tool designed to help users manage their time more efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique. This technique involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The goal is to enhance focus, maintain energy levels, and improve overall productivity.

## Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the application. (readline -> Built-in Node.js module for handling input and output in the console.)
Javascript :Programming language used for implementing the application logic.

## How It Works
The user is prompted to start the Pomodoro timer.
Upon confirmation, the application begins a work session countdown.
Once the work session ends, it automatically transitions to a break session, displaying appropriate messages.
After completing a set number of cycles, the timer switches to a long break.
The process continues until all cycles are completed.
